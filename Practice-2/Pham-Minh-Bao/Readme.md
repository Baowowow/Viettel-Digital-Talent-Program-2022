### I.Overview

#### 1. What is Ansible ?
**Ansible** is an IT automation tool which can configure systems, deploy software, handle clooud provisioning and orchestrate other advanced IT tasks.

- **Written in**: Python, PowerShell, Shell, Ruby
- **Operating system**: Linux, Unix-like, MacOS, Windows
- **License**: GNU General Public License v3.0 or later

#### 2. Principles of Ansible
- **Simple**: Get productive quickly
    - Simple setup process with a minimal learning curve
    - Describe infrastructure in a language that is both machine and human friendly
    - Tasks executed in order
- **Powerful**: Orchestration the app lifecycle
    - Manage machines quickly and in parallel
    - Configuration management
    - App deployment
    - Manage new remote machines instantly, without bootstrapping any software
- **Agentless**: More efficient & More secure
    - Uses OpenSSH & WinRM
    - Agentless architecture
    - Avoid custom-agents and additional open ports

#### 3. Ansible architecture
`Ansible` can support whatever actions you want to execute in a server. 
`Ansible` issues all commands from a central location to perform these tasks. `Ansible` work on push mode over ssh connection (push configurations to server over ssh connection)

#### 4. Ansible Terminology
- **Controller Machine**: Any machine with `Ansible` installed
- **Configuration**: Adjust settings in `Ansible`
- **Inventory**: A file that contains the hosts and groups of remote hosts
- **Ad-Hoc command**: Refers to running `Ansible` to perform some quick command and you donâ€™t want to save for later or write a full playbook
- **Playbook**: Playbooks are Ansible's configuration, deployment and orchestration language
- **Task**: 
  - Playbooks exist to run tasks
  - Task are executed in order, one at a time, against all hosts matched by the host pattern before moving on to the next task
  - Hosts with failed tasks are taken out of the rotation for the entire playbook
- **Module**:
  - Modules are the units of work that `Ansible` ships out to remote machines
  - Take parameters and conditions to perform the action, and return JSON format data
  - Flexible to write the custom modules: can be written in any language as long as they output JSON
- **Role**: 
  - Roles are units of organization in `Ansible`
  - Roles are set of tasks and additional files for a certain role which allow you to break up the configurations
